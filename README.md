MegaCorp Social Community Bulletin Board:

For our second project we developed a company bulletin board.

Three client-side routes are available to the user for navigating our site. The routes are Home, Employee Profile, and Sign up.

From our db.json file, data is imported into our website and our react components are populated with this data.

We have provided the user with the ability to post a comment to the bulletin and great a new profile.
